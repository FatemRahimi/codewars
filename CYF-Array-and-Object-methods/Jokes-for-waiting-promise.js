/*Here are some classic Christmas cracker jokes.

There is a made up API URL (http://great.jokes/christmas) that you can call to a get list of Christmas jokes in JSON format.

Your challenge
Write an async function which takes an apiUrl and jokeId which returns a promise.
The data will need to be filtered to get the specified joke by id.
When you got the joke it should be accessible through a simple API of saySetup and sayPunchLine methods.
Handle error cases

If a joke can't be found throw an error message in this format new Error('No jokes found id: {jokeId}').
Getting jokes from a another API URL may return a different data shape, throw this error message new Error('No jokes at url: {url}') for an unexpected shape.
Throw error in a promise style

Info
Get the data using the mocked fetch(url) function, which implements the basics of the fetch api. Learn about fetch. Learn about async/await.

Joke data shape:

{
  jokes: [{ 
    id: 101,
    setup: "Who is Santa's favorite singer?",
    punchLine: "Elf-is Presley!"
  },
...moreJokes]
*/

const sayJoke = async (apiUrl, jokeId) => {
    const data = await fetch(apiUrl).then((res, err) => {
      if (err) throw new Error(`No jokes at url: ${apiUrl}`);
      return res.json();
    }).then((data) => {
      if (!data.jokes || !data) throw new Error(`No jokes at url: ${apiUrl}`);
      return data.jokes;
    });
  
    const joke = data.find((e) => e.id === jokeId);
    if (!joke) throw new Error(`No jokes found id: ${jokeId}`);
    return {
      ...joke,
      saySetup() {
        return this.setup;
      },
      sayPunchLine() {
        return this.punchLine;
      },
    };
  };
